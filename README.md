# The Use of Cost Survey Data to Calculate Vessel Profits for Commercial Fishing Fleets in the Northeast U.S.

# Background

Profit is an important metric in assessing the economic performance of commercial fishing fleets and in evaluating the impacts of proposed regulations, as required by applicable laws. Within the Northeast United States, commercial revenues are readily available to NOAA Fisheries, as all federally permitted vessels are required to report sales to licensed dealers. Cost data, on the other hand, have generally been the limiting factor in calculating vessel profits. 
The Northeast Fisheries Science Center conducts a voluntary survey, sent intermittently since the early 2000s, to collect comprehensive cost information from commercial fishing vessel owners. This survey was last implemented during March-July 2023 for costs incurred during calendar year 2022. One of the primary goals of the survey is to calculate vessel-level profits; this goal was communicated throughout the outreach process leading up to and during implementation of the most recent survey. 
Using data primarily collected from the most recent cost survey, this paper highlights the methods/process for calculating 2022 profit for commercial vessels who participated in the survey effort. These methods support the profit snapshots which serve as a key performance metric in evaluating the economic impacts of proposed fishery management actions in the future. 

# Social Sciences Cost Survey

Starting in 2007, the Social Sciences Branch (SSB) of the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) has intermittently collected commercial fishing cost information from vessel owners. Information is collected through a voluntary survey which includes questions on costs such as vessel repairs and improvements, vessel insurance, trip expenses, crew payments, and overhead. The most recent survey, formally known as the Greater Atlantic Region Commercial Fishing Business Cost Survey for 2022 (hereafter 2022 cost survey), was fielded in 2023 to collect costs incurred by vessel owners during calendar year 2022. Each owner of a federally permitted commercial fishing vessel that was active in either calendar year 2021 or 2022 received a survey. A total of 2,495 individuals were sent the 2022 cost survey with 422 surveys returned. After accounting for incomplete returned surveys and ineligibles within the sampling frame, the final response rate was 14.8% (367/2,477). This response rate was slightly lower than the 16.8% average response rate over the six previous cost surveys fielded since 2007. For further details on the implementation of the 2022 cost survey see Werner et al. (2024). For more information on early iterations of the cost survey, see Das (2015) and Ardini et al. (2022).

# Metrics

There are a number of different metrics to measure net returns to commercial fishing businesses (Kitts 2022). A cash flow statement, an income statement, and an economic profit statement. A cash flow statement is typically performed over time. An economic profit statement includes the opportunity costs of capital and labor. We choose to provide modified income statements looking at both operating profit and total profit. These two metrics are described below and in Figure 1.
Modified Income Statement: Operating Profit
Operating profit refers to gross revenues minus operating (variable costs). Within the cost survey, two sections in particular cover operating costs. The trip expenses section collects information on fuel, bait, ice, food. The crew payment section includes the total amount to crew and hired captain, as well as any benefits paid out. Outside of the survey, observer costs are also included in the operating profit calculation.
Modified Income Statement: Total Profit
Total profit refers to operating profit minus non-operating costs. These costs can be both fixed and quasi-fixed. Fixed costs include mooring fees, permit fees, and vessel insurance. Within the cost survey, a few different sections 

# Respondent Pool

A total of 422 surveys were returned to the Social Sciences Branch at the conclusion of the 2022 cost survey. The profit calculations above were first performed for all 422 observations followed by a series of steps to eliminate those observations that were deemed inappropriate to include in the snapshot.
Filtering of Observations
The first filtering step followed the same process described in Werner et al. 2024 in which returned surveys must have answered at least one cost-related question (Complete_1=1 and REFUSAL_INELIGIBLE_PARTIAL=0). This step eliminated 55 observations, bringing the total  number down to 367. Some surveys were complete but the vessel was inactive during 2022 (vessel activity = “INACTIVE” or “REC_OR_OTHER”); the elimination of these 34 observations brought the total to 333. Additionally, 20 surveys were considered complete and the vessel was active during 2022 but no commercial revenue was found in the CAMS_LAND table. These initial filtering steps left a total of 313 observations. 

Upon completion of the initial filtering steps, a few secondary steps were performed. The survey was divided into sections to evaluate the number of sections skipped for each response. A total of 16 observations out of 313 skipped multiple survey sections. After a brief visual assessment, these observations were deemed to be missing too many potential costs for inclusion. A total of 12 observations out of the remaining 297 skipped one survey section. These cases were more critically evaluated. Four out of the 12 only skipped the crew payment section. Since these were all small vessels with relatively low costs and operating profit, assuming there was no crew onboard was deemed appropriate.
